# Rupā the guardian

**Rupā** is a tool for managing WireGuard VPNs. It aims to make managing VPNs simple and user-friendly. The project includes :

- a modern web app that makes it easy to manage VPN users
- a main server capable of handling multiple VPN sites, providing centralized control and management
- desktop and mobile apps that let users connect using an username and password instead of complicated QR codes
- a way to update user settings in the web app without asking users to manually change their configurations.

**Rupā** makes managing and using VPNs easy and clear, even for those who aren’t tech experts.

## Inspiration

**Rupā** is inspired by [**wg-easy**](https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy/), which is a simple way to manage WireGuard servers. Rupā builds on this idea to make things even easier with a modern interface and more features.
